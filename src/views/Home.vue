                    Electric vehicles are taking over the world. By 2030, nearly a third of all vehicles in America will be electric. Due to consumers shifting from fossil fuels to safer alternatives, the automotive industry is preparing for a major shift.

                    Because of this, TSA has tasked members competing in the Webmaster event to create a website about embracing electric vehicles. From now through mid-May, the Choctaw TSA Webmaster team will be developing a website that accomplishes just that. Stay tuned.
